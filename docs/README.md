# Dining Philosophers

A concurrent simulation of the classic Dining Philosophers synchronization problem using POSIX threads and mutexes.

## Description

The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem that illustrates challenges in concurrent programming. This project implements a solution where philosophers sit at a round table with forks between them. Each philosopher alternates between thinking, eating, and sleeping. To eat, a philosopher must acquire both adjacent forks (mutexes), creating potential for deadlock and starvation. The simulation demonstrates proper use of mutexes and thread synchronization to prevent these issues.

**Goal**: Implement a deadlock-free solution where all philosophers can eat and no one starves, using POSIX threads and mutexes.

## Instructions

### Compilation

```bash
make
```

### Execution

```bash
./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
./philo 5 800 200 200 7
./philo 1 100 50 50
```

**Arguments:**
- `number_of_philosophers`: Number of philosophers and forks
- `time_to_die` (ms): Time before starvation if eating hasn't started
- `time_to_eat` (ms): Duration of eating
- `time_to_sleep` (ms): Duration of sleeping
- `[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]` (optional): Stop condition (all philosophers must eat this many times)

**Examples:**

```bash
./philo 5 800 200 200
./philo 5 800 200 200 7
./philo 4 410 200 200
```

### Project Structure

- **Main**: Parses input, initializes data structures, spawns philosopher threads and monitor
- **Philosopher threads**: Execute eat → sleep → think cycle
- **Monitor thread**: Detects philosopher death and signals simulation end
- **Synchronization**: Mutexes protect forks, shared state, and output

### AI Usage

AI assistance was used for:
- **Code structure and organization**: Helped design the overall architecture of threads, synchronization primitives, and module layout
- **Debugging timing and synchronization issues**: Identified race conditions and suggested proper mutex placement
- **Understanding spec requirements**: Clarified 42 project constraints and pthread API semantics
- **Code review**: Validated correctness of mutex locking patterns and thread lifecycle management

AI-generated code was thoroughly tested, understood, and validated before integration. All critical synchronization logic was peer-reviewed and adapted based on specific project constraints.
